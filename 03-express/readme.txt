Why ?
- server logic is complex.
- we want to focus on our business logic, not the nitty-gritty details!
- use a framework for the heavy lifting.

What is Framework?
- A Set of helper functions and also a suite of tools & rules that help us build our application.

Alternative to Express.js 
- Vanilla node.js
- Adonis.js 
- Koa.js
- Sails.js
.....

Express.js is highly flexible and widely used.
